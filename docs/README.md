# OctoAcme Project Management Overview

This folder contains OctoAcme's project management guidance and artifacts. The project's approach is lightweight, outcome-focused, and blends agile practices with clear governance.

Summary of core processes

- **Project Initiation:** Define goals, stakeholders, success criteria, and a brief project charter to align expectations early.
- **Project Planning:** Create a roadmap and prioritized backlog, estimate work, and identify milestones and deliverables.
- **Execution & Tracking:** Run short iterations (or feature-focused cycles), hold regular check-ins, track progress with clear metrics, and maintain status updates.
- **Release & Deployment:** Use CI/CD pipelines, feature flags, and defined release gates with rollback plans to ensure safe deployments.
- **Retrospective & Continuous Improvement:** Hold regular retrospectives, capture action items, and track improvements via small, measurable experiments.
- **Risk & Communication:** Maintain a risk register, define escalation paths, and run stakeholder communications on a consistent cadence.
- **Roles & Personas:** Clarify responsibilities (product owner, project manager, tech lead, engineers, QA, and operations) to reduce handoff friction.
