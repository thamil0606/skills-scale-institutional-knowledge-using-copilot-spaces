# Risk Escalation & Communication Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure risks are documented, tracked, and escalated appropriately.

- [ ] Identify and log risk with description, impact, likelihood, and owner
- [ ] Classify risk severity (Low / Medium / High / Critical)
- [ ] Define mitigation actions and assign owners
- [ ] Set review cadence for open risks (weekly/biweekly as appropriate)
- [ ] Escalate High/Critical risks to Project Manager and Stakeholder/Sponsor
- [ ] Capture decision and track outcomes in the project decision log
- [ ] Communicate risk status in regular stakeholder updates
- [ ] After mitigation, document lessons learned in the retrospective
